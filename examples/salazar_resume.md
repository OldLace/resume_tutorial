Experience

**Some Tech Company - Senior Devops Software Engineer | Jan 2015 - April 2017**

DevTools' goal was to reduce and simplify the deployment process for all of the components within the company. We created a new system that allowed for safe one-click deployments. I was responsible for rolling out the new process by teaching developers how to use Chef and AWS Resources effectively.

- created the authentication/authorization process for all applications
- created framework for deployments to meet security standards for SOC II Compliance
- created database encryption library for Java projects (with Dropwizard plugin)
- reduced cost of operating company by more than half (110k/month to 55k/month) while supporting more than 10x (7k to 80k) the active users
- managed all of the third party infrastructure for the company with minimal turn around time
- acted as the self-assigned in-house baker for the Brooklyn team
- tech stack: Sinatra, Chef, Ruby, Java, Jenkins, AWS, Hashicorp Vault, Terraform, Node, Angular

**Some Consulting Company - Software Consultant | Nov 2012 - Dec 2014**

As a consultant, I was exposed to best practices across the technology space. The biggest take away is that software is created by people. I had the opportunity to work across different domains (Internal HR, Commercial Airline, Healthcare).

- Peoplesoft/Salesforce integration and rollout across an entire company
- updated pilot and crewmember training requirements for airline regulation compliance
